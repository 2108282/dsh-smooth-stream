## The Silky Smooth Feel

Whether reviewing hundreds of lines of complex reasoning or watching fast-paced code generation, `dsh-smooth-stream` delivers a **calm, continuous, and fatigue-free** reading experience:

- **Organic, fluid text expansion**: No more walls of text abruptly snapping onto your screen. Words glide in with an organic rhythm that feels alive yet unhurried.
- **Effortless eye tracking**: The viewport glides as if on a precision-damped rail. Line wraps and code blocks no longer jar your eyes, eliminating cognitive friction.
- **Adaptive cadence**: Leisurely during slow arrivals, smoothly accelerating during high-volume bursts—keeping your screen composed no matter how fast tokens arrive.

## Why this exists

Large language models emit tokens in discrete network bursts: hundreds of characters can arrive within milliseconds, followed by tens of milliseconds of silence.

Traditional chat UIs bind DOM rendering and scrolling directly to arrival events, causing two jarring failure modes:
1. **Visual snapping**: Text blocks, tables, and code snippets pop in abruptly, forcing the reader's eye to constantly re-acquire focus.
2. **Scroll jitter and reflow storms**: Hard `scrollTop = scrollHeight` jumps or interrupted `scroll-behavior: smooth` animations restart their easing curves on every chunk, leading to sluggish lag and severe layout thrashing.

`dsh-smooth-stream` decouples **text reveal cadence** from **viewport motion** into two independent dynamical systems, integrating them per animation frame (`requestAnimationFrame`) to ensure uninterrupted continuity.

```

### 1. Dynamic Adaptive Reveal Engine
- **Fractional character debt**: Evaluates reveal velocity from current backlog ($v = 90 + \text{backlog}^{1.25} \times P$). Leisurely when arrival is slow; accelerates smoothly during bursts without ever dumping text walls.
- **Wrap smoothing**: Caps per-frame visual displacement to $\le 8\text{px}$ during line wraps and new block arrivals, spreading sudden $24\text{--}28\text{px}$ layout steps across several frames.
- **Uniform completion drain**: When the generation finishes, the residual queue drains at a steady speed, creating clean transitions between body, reasoning, and tool calls.

### 2. GPU-Driven Damped Spring Follower
- **Second-order spring physics**: Uses a sub-stepped damped spring ($k=130, c=24, m=1$) to convert discrete height changes into a continuous trajectory.
- **Zero-reflow viewport tracking**: Keeps the real scrollport pinned to the bottom while absorbing residual visual lag entirely via `transform: translate3d` on the message container. No layout-triggering properties are touched during follow.
- **Closed-loop backpressure**: If visual lag fills the predictive runway ($\approx 72\text{px}$), the follower throttles reveal speed (down to $0.55\times$), ensuring text expansion never outpaces the viewport spring.
- **Stall resilience & ProMotion parity**: Clamps elapsed physical time ($\Delta t \le 32\text{ms}$) during main-thread stalls to prevent teleporting catches. Settling dynamics are identical across 60Hz and 120Hz (ProMotion) displays.

### 3. Turn Lifecycle Auto-Collapse
- Reasoning and tool executions remain expanded while streaming.
- Once a turn settles, intermediate processes cleanly fold behind a minimalist `Processed in Xs` summary row, keeping the conversation view focused on final answers.

### 4. Reactive Baton Relay Queue

When models perform complex reasoning or multi-step Agent loops, their output typically transitions through distinct phases: **Reasoning Chain → Preamble Response Text → Tool Execution**.

Under DeepSeek Harness's decoupled presentation layer, these phases are mounted across independent React subtrees. Uncoordinated rendering causes reasoning, text, and tools to burst simultaneously, clashing for visual focus, triggering layout thrashing, and causing frame drops on mobile devices.

`dsh-smooth-stream` implements an event-driven **Baton Relay Queue (`streamRelay`)** to guarantee strict sequential execution across all stages:

```
[ Model Generation Stream ]
            │
            ▼
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Phase 1: Reasoning Chain Reveal                       │
│  - Smooth progressive expansion & logarithmic fade     │
│  - Text and tools stay suspended in place (0 CPU load) │
│  - Drains tail buffer at steady pace, then auto-folds  │
└───────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                            │ Relay handoff
                            ▼
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Phase 2: Response Text Streaming                      │
│  - Begins smooth reveal from character 0               │
│  - 2nd-order damped spring glide, zero visual leaps    │
│  - Holds tool lock active during entire reveal         │
│  - Unlocks downstream tools after text settle finishes │
└───────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                            │ Lock released
                            ▼
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Phase 3: Tool Execution & Entrance                    │
│  - Tool cards unlock and glide in with 120ms GPU ease  │
│  - Tool execution and result display proceed cleanly   │
│  - Zero DOM loss, zero focus jumping                   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Zero-Polling Reactivity**: Bypasses costly DOM `MutationObserver` traversals entirely by subscribing via React 18 `useSyncExternalStore` to an atomic in-memory state machine. Delivers sub-millisecond coordination and sustains 60/120fps fluid playback even on mobile devices.
- **Mental Model Alignment**: Guarantees that reasoning completes and folds before text streams, and preamble text completely reveals before tool execution cards appear.

### 5. Running Status & Bottom Baseline Stabilization
- **Accurate DSH Status Container Targeting**: Specifically matches Harness's native running indicator via `[data-chat-running]` (including the "Deep diving..." status and `runningDivider`), strictly isolating it from ordinary message transform surfaces (`shiftSurfaces`).
- **Eliminates Bottom Bobbing & Whiplash**: Prevents the status container from inheriting dynamic `transform: translate3d`, eliminating the artifact where the bottom edge was steadily dragged upward during line reveals and snapped downward upon hard text wraps.
- **Proper Layout Runway Placement**: Directs predictive layout runway margins into the status container's `marginTop` rather than bottom padding, ensuring the running indicator and divider stay rock-solid at the bottom of the viewport throughout generation.

## Kernel Compatibility

| DSH kernel | This plugin |
|---|---|
| 0.1.0-rc.5 - 0.1.0-rc.7 | ✅ all versions |
| 0.1.1-rc.2 | ✅ all versions |
| 0.1.2-alpha.1 - 0.1.2-alpha.3 | ✅ 0.4.3+; 0.4.2 and earlier fail to load on 0.1.2 because they statically import the removed helper |

- ✅ = compatible. `0.1.2-alpha.3` is the current host kernel and has been verified live (built-artifact import + test suites); the remaining kernels are covered by the dual-kernel-compatible design (one build, one API surface).
- **Kernel 0.1.2 removed the `settingsNamespace()` runtime helper** (on ≤ 0.1.1 it was a validating identity function; 0.1.2 keeps only the same-named type). This plugin does not statically import that symbol any more — it inlines its namespace constant locally and asserts it as the `SettingsNamespace` type, which works on both old and new kernels.
- Since 0.4.3 the plugin no longer statically imports `settingsNamespace()` (see the compat fix in git history); older versions only work on kernels ≤ 0.1.1.
- **Never statically import runtime symbols from `@deepseek-ai/*` packages.** The host CLI starts via `node --import tsx/esm`, and tsx applies the host `tsconfig` `paths` mapping, so a bare `@deepseek-ai/*` import from an external plugin may be redirected into the host's own sources — any host-side rename or removal then explodes at boot as a module instantiation error. Type-only imports (`import type`) are unaffected.

## Presets & Configuration

The plugin defaults to `preset: balanced`. You can tune the cadence in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

| `preset` | Characteristics |
| :--- | :--- |
| `realtime` | Low buffer; closely follows model token arrival |
| `balanced` | Recommended default; balances smoothness and latency |
| `silky` | Generous buffer with gentler acceleration curves |

## User Preferences

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin Configuration** in the Web UI:

**Logarithmic fade** (on by default) adapts the tail from 24 to at most 160 graphemes according to reveal speed, fading answers and expanded thinking from 0% opacity over 240ms with a reversed logarithmic curve that stays translucent longer. Text settles even during network pauses. Turning it off preserves text pacing and scrolling. It follows the motion preference and skips code, formulas and thinking summaries. Browsers without text-range highlighting support retain the existing reveal behavior.

For a local preview, run `pnpm build:repro`, serve the repository with `python3 -m http.server 8765 --bind 127.0.0.1`, and open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/repro/index.html?demo=fade`. This uses the real reveal/fade hooks with synthetic rich-text fixtures. Run `node scripts/verify-logarithmic-fade.mjs` to check and record it (Chrome and `pnpm exec playwright-core install ffmpeg` required; override the Chrome path with `CHROME_BIN`). Reports and recordings go to the ignored `repro/artifacts/logarithmic-fade/` directory.

- **Enable smooth streaming** (default on): Toggles custom stream rendering and follow. Disabling instantly falls back to built-in Harness rendering.
- **Auto-expand thinking**: Controls whether reasoning opens automatically while streaming.
- **Collapse finished work** (default on): Folds thoughts and tool steps into a summary line once the turn settles.
- **Show render diagnostics** (default off): Opens a live HUD on the right side to inspect FPS, character backlog, spring state, and adjust physical parameters in real time.
